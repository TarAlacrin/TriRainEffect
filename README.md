# TriRainEffect

I started this project like 2 years ago before it was possible to get skinned mesh data into VFX graph. 

I utilize a few tricks that I learned from picking apart Keijiro Takahashi's work to do it anyways.

Its really pretty, but a bit unfinished. I need to record it and post a video.
